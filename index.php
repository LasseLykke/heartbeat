                <h3 class="projectName">Salongitte.dk</h3>
                <p>Salon Gitte's website has been crafted using HTML and SASS. When my friend, a hairdresser, needed an update to her website, I took the opportunity to assist.<br>
                The primary objective for the website was to be static, requiring no frequent updates, as her clients primarily engage with her business through Facebook. The website serves as a point of reference, displaying crucial information such as Salon Gitte's opening hours and providing a simple and accessible way for potential clients to get in touch.<br>
                In addition to the static content, I optimized the meta-tags to enhance Salon Gitte's visibility on Google, ensuring that her business stands out online and attracts more potential clients.</p>
